        position:"Through optimisation and automation, our IoT- based approach aims to provide a sustainable solution to plant management, which helps in conserving costs, increasing yield and decreasing wastage of water and electricity, while also making more effective use of pesticides. Allowing users from all walks of life to access and fulfil their plant/crop needs from anywhere, anytime and making changing climate change easy and accessible for everyone."

        position:"We, at The Consulting Club at Manipal, plan to conduct an in-depth analysis of MAHEâ€™s carbon footprint to recommend sustainable practices that can be implemented. We plan to devise a Strategic Energy Plan and a Zero Waste Action Plan through which, we aim to achieve a concrete set of data and insights that can be used by stakeholders to make MAHE truly carbon-free."

        position:"One tiny seed grows into a humongous tree. Just like seeds, humans have the potential to make this world a better place. Gardening is beneficial to one's mental health as well as the environment. With this project, we aim to study these effects and cultivate a gardening culture among the students of Manipal."

        position:"The current world is undergoing a global energy change. Among all possible substitutes for fossil fuels, hydrogen serves as a praising future energy form. In this TEDx MAHE live project, our team intends to harness energy from starch wastes to drive whole-cell hydrogen production in aerobic conditions. We will construct a recombinant strain of Escherichia coli to express the hydrogenase and relevant enzymes and a bioreactor to upscale the production. This project will spark new light onto biological hybrid methods in the development of new energy forms."
